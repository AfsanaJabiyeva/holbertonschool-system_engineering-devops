1. What is a server?
A server is a computer that stores and runs websites or apps so others can access them online.

2. What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (like foobar.com) is the website's name that people can remember and type instead of using a number (IP address).

3. What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
It’s an A record, which connects the name www.foobar.com to the server’s IP address (like 8.8.8.8).

4. What is the role of the web server?
The web server (Nginx) receives the request from the user’s browser and passes it to the app server. It also sends back the result to the user.

5. What is the role of the application server?
The application server runs the code of the website. It handles the logic, like logging in users or showing posts.

6. What is the role of the database?
The database (MySQL) stores the website’s data — like usernames, passwords, and blog content.

7. What is the server using to talk to the user’s computer?
It uses the Internet and speaks in HTTP or HTTPS (web communication protocols).

Problems with This Infrastructure
1. SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
If the one server crashes, the whole website goes down.

2. Downtime during maintenance:
When you update or restart the server (e.g., for new code), the website is temporarily offline.

3. Cannot scale:
If too many users visit at once, the single server gets overloaded and slows down or crashes.
