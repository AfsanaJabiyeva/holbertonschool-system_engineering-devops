1. For every additional element, why are you adding it?

- Load Balancer (HAProxy): Added to distribute traffic between multiple servers. This improves performance and reduces the chance of one server getting overloaded.
- Second Server: Added to avoid a single point of failure and to help handle more users at the same time.
- Duplicated Web/App/DB Stack: Both servers have Nginx, app files, and a MySQL DB to serve requests independently if one goes down.

2. What distribution algorithm is your load balancer configured with and how does it work?

- Algorithm: Round Robin
- How it works: The load balancer sends each new request to the next server in line, one after another, in a repeating loop. This balances traffic evenly between servers.

3. Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup? Explain the difference.

- The setup is Active-Active.
- Active-Active: Both servers are running and handling traffic at the same time.
- Active-Passive: One server handles everything while the other stays idle unless the first one fails.

4. How does a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster work?

- The Primary (Master) database handles all writes (insert, update, delete).
- The Replica (Slave) database copies the data from the Primary and handles read-only requests (select).
- This reduces the load on the Primary and helps with backup and data availability.

5. What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?

- The application sends write operations (e.g., user sign-up) to the Primary node.
- It sends read operations (e.g., viewing a profile) to the Replica node.
- The Replica is synced from the Primary but cannot be written to directly by the application.

6. What are the issues with this infrastructure?

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The load balancer is a SPOF. If it fails, users cannot reach the servers.
- Security Issues:
   - No firewall: The servers are open to all traffic, including potential attacks.
   - No HTTPS: Data between user and server is not encrypted, so it can be intercepted.
- No Monitoring: There’s no system to alert you if a server crashes or performance drops. You wouldn’t know there’s a problem unless you check manually.
